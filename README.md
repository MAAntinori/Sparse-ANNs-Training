# Sparse-ANNs-Training

##Overview
This repository contains Python code for training and evaluating convolutional neural network (CNN), DenseNet, and ResNet models on a small image dataset. The code includes functionalities for model pruning, quantization, and energy consumption calculation during both training and inference. 
The models are trained on an 8x8, 16x16 and 32x32 pixels image dataset related to malaria detection.
